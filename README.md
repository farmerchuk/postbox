### Postbox

Postbox is a simple messaging app I created as a project for the web
development course at Launch School. This app is written in Ruby and uses
the Sinatra framework. It's designed to be somewhat similar to other messaging apps that are out there.  At its core, you can create an account, add other users as contacts and send messages back and forth.  

Postbox uses a file-based database to keep track of users and their messages and contacts.  As such, I'd recommend hosting locally if you'd like to play around with it.

### Details

This app has a couple of extra features to enhance usability:

* Flash messages use JQuery and will disappear on their own after a few seconds
* When viewing the inbox, clicking on a received message will automatically open the compose window with the correct contact pre-selected
