### Postbox

Postbox is a simple messaging app I created as a project for the web
development course at Launch School. This app is written in Ruby and uses
the Sinatra framework.

### Details

This app has a couple of extra features to enhance usability:

* Flash messages use JQuery and will disappear on their own after a few seconds
* When viewing the inbox, clicking on a received message will automatically open the compose window with the correct contact pre-selected
